Game: You pick a random number btw  0 and 1.  Then you keep picking random numbers (btw 0 and 1) until you pick one which was smaller than the last one you picked.  At that point the game is over.

I will pay you the # of numbers you picked.

For example:
If you pick 0.2, then 0.9, then 0.5, the game stops (since 0.5 < 0.9) and I pay you $3.

How much would you pay to play this game?

Before seeing any coin flips, you could imagine having priors of
P(fair-coin, i.e. pheads = 0.5) = 0.98, P(coin has pheads = 0.9) =
0.01, P(coin has ptails = 0.9) = 0.01.  If you see series
"HHHHHHHHHH", what's your posterior distribution?
