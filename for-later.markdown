You and I play a game where we take turns rolling a die. I win if I roll a 4. You win if you roll a 5.

If I go first, whatâ€™s the probability that I win?

Game: You pick a random number btw  0 and 1.  Then you keep picking random numbers (btw 0 and 1) until you pick one which was smaller than the last one you picked.  At that point the game is over.

I will pay you the # of numbers you picked.

For example:
If you pick 0.2, then 0.9, then 0.5, the game stops (since 0.5 < 0.9) and I pay you $3.

How much would you pay to play this game?

Before seeing any coin flips, you could imagine having priors of
P(fair-coin, i.e. pheads = 0.5) = 0.98, P(coin has pheads = 0.9) =
0.01, P(coin has ptails = 0.9) = 0.01.  If you see series
"HHHHHHHHHH", what's your posterior distribution?

9 balls, one is heavier, old school scale.  How many weighings?

10 kids in the class.  I'm going to split the class into groups of any size, but, unlike the last question, all kids will end up in a group.  Let me give examples of what I'm talking about.

Let's call this "grouping #1"

    Group 1 has kids: 1
	Group 2 has kids: 2,3,4,5,7
	Group 3 has kids: 6,8,9,10

This would *NOT* be different from "grouping #1" (i.e. if you switch "group 1" and "group 2" it doesn't matter):

    Group 1 has kids: 2,3,4,5,7
    Group 2 has kids: 1
	Group 3 has kids: 6,8,9,10

This would also *NOT* be different from "grouping #1" (i.e. I don't care about the order of kids within a group):

    Group 1 has kids: 1
	Group 2 has kids: 7,5,4,3,2
	Group 3 has kids: 6,8,9,10

This *would* be different from "grouping #1" (let's call it "grouping #2":

    Group 1 has kids: 1
	Group 2 has kids: 3,4,5,7
	Group 3 has kids: 2,6,8,9,10

Ok, now that you know the ground rules, `how many ways can I do this`?
