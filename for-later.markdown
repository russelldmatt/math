Game: You pick a random number btw  0 and 1.  Then you keep picking random numbers (btw 0 and 1) until you pick one which was smaller than the last one you picked.  At that point the game is over.

I will pay you the # of numbers you picked.

For example:
If you pick 0.2, then 0.9, then 0.5, the game stops (since 0.5 < 0.9) and I pay you $3.

How much would you pay to play this game?

Before seeing any coin flips, you could imagine having priors of
P(fair-coin, i.e. pheads = 0.5) = 0.98, P(coin has pheads = 0.9) =
0.01, P(coin has ptails = 0.9) = 0.01.  If you see series
"HHHHHHHHHH", what's your posterior distribution?

A high school has a strange principal. On the first day, he has his students perform an odd opening day ceremony:

There are one thousand lockers and one thousand students in the school. The principal asks the first student to go to every locker and open it. Then he has the second student go to every second locker and close it. The third goes to every third locker and, if it is closed, he opens it, and if it is open, he closes it. The fourth student does this to every fourth locker, and so on. After the process is completed with the thousandth student, `how many lockers are open?`
